Hey conference goers, bienvenidos!

In a joint effort between Miami Bitdevs, Austin Bitdevs, and Bitdevs NYC we are hosting our 4th Socratic Seminar on the day before the conference. A special thanks to our sponsors: BNY Mellon, CardCoins, and Mercury Wallet for food, event space and refreshments.

Please join us for some great discussion topics as well as a demo of Mercury Wallet, a layer two CoinSwap facility that uses a modified statechain protocol for off-chain private key transference. 

If you've never been to a Socratic Seminar before, please learn about the event format [here](https://miamibitdevs.org/about)
