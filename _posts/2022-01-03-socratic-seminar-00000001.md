We're celebrating Bitcoin's birthday with the genesis seminar in a new bitdevs socratic seminar series.

We will ease into it: we will lay out some basic
ground rules, make introductions and jump off from there.

Some topics we'll kick off with: Spiral SDK, DLCs, OP_CTV and a special presentation from the founder of Squeak Node
