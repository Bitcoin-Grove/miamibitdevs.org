Welcome back for the 2nd Miami BitDevs socratic seminar. We've found a new home for these events in little river miami and its a great place to dive into some interesting topics!

We'll get the discussion rolling with some taproot updates, schnorr signature basics, a look at bolt 12. After the seminar we'll have a demo of the scriptwiz editor and a preview of the bitmatrix beta.
